        <img src="./images/craig-west.jpg" style="width: 225px; height: 175px; padding: 0 20px; float: left"
          class="w3-circle" alt="Craig West" />
        <p>I have been in and out of construction for over 30 years.</p>

        <p>At one time, I have been a Gas Safe Registered Engineer, Registered Plumber with CIPHE, Part P
          Domestic
          Electrician and
          small works builder.</p>
        <p>Previous careers have been as an accountant and a Web Developer.</p>
        <p>For over 15 years, I was on Checkatrade with Small Jobs On Time Same Day Plumbers Ltd, with over 1,050
          reviews.</p>
        <p>I have come across quality trades people both professionally and for personal use in my home.</p>
        <p>I now do the marketing and coordinating for a tribe of trades people, each working independently with
          their own
          business, yet working collaboratively and accountably with the rest of the tribe.</p>

        <p>I have maintained that building issues occur at the interface of trades, where plumber meets tiler
          etc.
          The tribe avoids
          this as we are just that - one tribe.</p>
        <p>I am the first line with enquiries and can guide you to the appropriate trades person.</p>
        <p>I am also available to help you if you get 'unreasonable' quotes from others or want the insider's view of
          what work needs doing and what it is a fair price.</p>
        <p>
          <em>Please not that I just introduce you to the trades person. From that point on, the nature of the
            interaction
            is purely between you and them.</em>
        </p>
        <p><em>
            I am just passing on homeowners to them. Many are associated with trade bodies or Checkatrade who can
            assist in their usual way with any unresolved issues that arise.</em></p>
        <h1>Here are a few of the trades in the tribe:</h1>

        <p><b>Barry</b> - Barry is a Checkatrade roofer and chimney sweep, he also does XXXX...</p>
        <p><b>Karl</b>
          - Karl and I worked together in Small Job On Time Same Day Plumbers Ltd. Karl is a Checkatrade
          plumber and has one of the
          most
          well-equipped
          vans with practically all common parts. An excellent Saniflo engineer, he also does drainage and
          small
          jobs - generally
          SAME/NEXT DAY. He is NO-VAT which is particularly attractive for small jobs.</p>
        <p><b>Roland</b>
          - Roland is a friend of Karl and they go fishing together in Norway. He is a Gas Safe
          Registered
          Engineer,
          carrying out heating repairs and installations as well as complete bathrooms and kitchens. He is
          supported by two very
          capable trades people.</p>
        <p><b>'Sparky'</b>
          - Roland's brother is an electrician and I have used professionally and personally 3 electricians that I
          am
          happy to recommend.</p>
        <p><b>Adam</b>
          - Adam and I met as volounteers for a charity and runs a very effective
          and
          efficient
          clearance business.</p>
        <p><b>Michael and Jade</b>
          - A good friend of mine, Nick, helped build a sustainable gardening business with electric van for his son
          Michael and partner Jade.</p>
        <p><b>Louis</b>
          - Louis is also a member of that same charity as Adam and I. He runs a part time decorating business
          outside
          of his position
          in youth work. Mostly evenings and weekends.</p>
        <p><b>Pat</b>
          - Pat is a lifelong builder and now works part-time as a builder, but obviously can be full-time as
          needed.
          Another volounteer at the charity!
          With a range of interests, he strives for work/life balance.</p>
        <p><b>'Bob'</b>
          - Growing up, the Scouts would offer their time to do tasks for a 'bob', which was one shilling or 5p in
          todays money. 'Bob' does those small handyperson jobs that are not economically viable for trades - put up
          a
          shelf, flat packs, fix handle etc. Sometimes you just need an extra pair of hands or general labour. 'Bob' can
          help.</p>
        <p>Many know other trades themselves so there are a good number of trades in a very wide range of services.</p>
